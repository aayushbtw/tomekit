# tomekit

Fully typed content collections for Markdown. Content is parsed and validated at build time and served as generated modules, so nothing is parsed at runtime.

Goal: the best API and DX, fully typed, fast. The one real consumer is `../portfolio` (it depends on the published `tomekit` from npm).

## Commands

A Vite+ monorepo: the library is `packages/tomekit`, apps go in `apps/`. Prefer Vite+ built-ins (`vp create`, `vp run`, `pack` options) over custom scripts. Paths below are relative to `packages/tomekit` unless they say otherwise.

```sh
pnpm check   # format + lint + typecheck for the whole repo (vp check); `pnpm fix` autofixes
pnpm test    # vitest in every package (vp run -r test)
pnpm build   # every package; the library runs vp pack → packages/tomekit/dist
```

Shared fmt and lint config lives in the root `vite.config.ts`; package-specific lint rules go in its `overrides` with workspace globs, since Vite+ ignores `lint` in package configs. Each package's own `vite.config.ts` holds only its build, test or app config.

Before calling a change done, run `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`. For changes to runtime output or generated types, also check the portfolio: `pnpm build`, then in `../portfolio` temporarily set the `tomekit` dependency to `file:../tomekit/packages/tomekit` and run `pnpm install && pnpm exec vp build && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`. Afterwards restore its `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to what they were, and run `pnpm install` again. Its uncommitted files belong to the user, so never revert them.

## Structure

Pure modules, one class that owns state, and a thin adapter, each in its own files.

| Layer | Files | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public types + config | `index.ts` | Types, `define*` helpers and the error classes. No IO |
| Runtime | `query.ts`, `content.ts` | Ships to users' servers. Keep it tiny |
| Pure core | `errors/` (one class per file), `value.ts` (`ContentValue` and its checks), `config.ts` (config checks), `parse.ts` (a Markdown file into an entry), `validate.ts` (an entry through the schema), `document.ts` (a source plus a transform result), `serialize.ts`, `generate.ts` (source strings) | No disk, no Vite, no state. Input in, result out |
| IO per collection | `directory.ts` (the built-in loader), `collection.ts` | `directory.ts` reads files into entries. `collection.ts` runs a loader, validates and transforms, and returns `{ documents, errors, warnings }` |
| State | `builder.ts` (`ContentBuilder`) | Owns config, per-collection results and caches, and the in-flight build. Knows nothing about how errors are shown |
| Adapter | `vite.ts` | Maps Vite hooks to loader calls and reports results. No content logic |

- New logic goes into the lowest layer that can hold it. If a function needs neither the disk nor state, put it in a pure module.
- Name each file after its one concern (`parse.ts`, `serialize.ts`). Split a file when it takes on a second concern, not when it gets long.
- State lives in a class with `#private` fields and `readonly` where possible, not in `let`s inside a closure.
- Keep one explicit `export { ... }` list at the bottom of each file. No `export *` barrels, since the public surface is only what `package.json` `exports` lists.
- One test file per source module in `test/` (`collection.ts` → `collection.test.ts`). Type-level tests go in `test/types.ts`, which is checked by `pnpm check` and never run.

## Errors

- **Return problems, don't throw them.** Lower layers return results (`{ document } | { issues }`, `{ entries, errors }`). The throw-or-report decision is made once, in the adapter: `vite build` throws, dev logs the errors, shows them in the overlay and serves the files that work.
- **Collect, don't stop.** Report every broken file in one pass.
- **Point at the source.** A content problem is a `ContentError` printed as `file:line:column: message`, with `file` relative to the root. When a key is missing, point at the deepest parent that exists. With no frontmatter at all, leave line and column out.
- **Messages name the fix.** Say what went wrong, then what to do: ``transform returned "url", but it can only return `metadata` and `body`. Put derived values inside `metadata` instead``.
- **Warnings state the consequence**: `directory "x" has no files, so collections.get("x") is empty`.
- Only the adapter adds the `[tomekit]` prefix and talks to the logger. Lower layers return plain strings.
- **Every thrown error is a class in `src/errors/`**, one per file, exported from `src/errors/index.ts`. No `throw new Error(...)` in `src/`. Classes extend a category (`ConfigError`, `ContentError`, `TransformError`, `PluginError`), which extends `TomekitError`. Each sets `name` explicitly, and its constructor takes data and builds the message, so the wording lives with the class. Add a class per distinct failure, not per call site.
- An error that wraps another passes it as `cause`.

## TSDoc

Public exports get TSDoc: a one-sentence summary, then an `@example` that runs as written. Results go in trailing comments.

````ts
/**
 * The document with this slug.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * collections.get("posts").get("hello-world").metadata.title // "Hello world"
 * ```
 */
````

- Document everything users import from `tomekit`, `tomekit/content` and `tomekit/vite`, plus each option field.
- Add `@param` / `@returns` only when they say something the name and type don't (units, what `undefined` means, ownership).
- Internal functions get no TSDoc unless they have a contract the types can't express. Never add docs to a function just because its neighbors have them.
- Inline comments explain only the non-obvious _why_, never restate the line.

## Code style

Lint is oxlint with anti-slop (vendored in the root `tools/oxlint/anti-slop/`) and a short explicit rule list in the root `vite.config.ts`, no preset. Anti-slop always wins:

- Never turn off, loosen or suppress an anti-slop rule to make code pass. Change the code.
- When another rule conflicts with writing code the anti-slop way, turn that rule off in the root `vite.config.ts` with a one-line reason. Don't write code that dodges both.
- Add a rule to the list when it would have caught a real problem, not because a preset has it.
- Unknown input is checked once at its boundary with an assertion or type predicate (eg `assertContentValue`), then handled as a named type. No `typeof`; tell primitives apart by boxing them (`new Object(value) instanceof Number`).
- A parameter typed `unknown` is only allowed when it is named `cause` or is a type predicate's subject.

The linter enforces most of these, so match them up front instead of relying on `pnpm fix`:

- Use `interface` for object shapes, including reshaped ones (`interface A extends Omit<B, "k"> {}`). Use `type` only for unions, function types and mapped or conditional types.
- Types inferred from user schemas are wrapped once in `Prettify` (`{ [K in keyof T]: T[K] } & {}`), so errors print the flat fields instead of nested helper names. Use `PrettifyIfPlainObject` where a value might be an array or a built-in (Date, Map, Set, RegExp), which must keep their own type. Don't generate named interfaces to work around this.
- Helper types that exist only for generated code or the type system get `@internal` in their TSDoc.
- Use function declarations, not arrow consts (`func-style`). Arrows are fine as inline callbacks.
- Use `async`/`await` with `try`/`catch`, not `.then`/`.catch` chains.
- Object keys sorted, no chained assignment, no `any` or unsafe assertions (in tests too).
- Put options objects with defaults in the signature: `function tomekit({ config = "tomekit.config.ts" }: TomekitOptions = {})`.
- Name the value a function returns (`serialize`, `accessor`, `summary`) or the action it takes (`loadCollection`, `writeTypes`).

## Internal notes

User-facing behavior, including what fails at compile time, build time or not at all, is documented in the docs site (`apps/docs/content/docs`). Update it in the same change as the code. `.claude/internal/` holds only what users don't need. Read it before designing, naming or recommending anything:

- `principles.md`: how to decide and what to recommend
- `naming.md`: one word per concept
- `architecture.md`: settled design, reopened only when one blocks the best API
- `out-of-scope.md`: what tomekit doesn't do on purpose
- `experiments.md`: designs that failed, and measurements

Record a new rule, decision or name there, not here.
