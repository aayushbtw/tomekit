A collection is a named set of documents: `posts`, `authors`, `docs`. Everything in it comes from one `loader`, which says where its entries come from, and passes one `schema`, which validates each entry's metadata. The name you give it in `defineConfig` is the name you read it by, `collections.get("posts")`.

A document is one validated entry. Every document in every collection has the same four fields, and only their types differ:

- `slug`: its key inside the collection, eg `hello-world`
- `metadata`: the schema's output, eg a file's frontmatter
- `body`: the text under the frontmatter, or whatever `transform` returned
- `file`: `{ name, path }`, or `undefined` when the entry came from no file

So a folder of Markdown and rows from an API are read the same way, and a field from your schema can never clash with a field tomekit sets.

## Loaders

### Files in a directory

`directory()` loads each Markdown file in a folder. Its frontmatter becomes the metadata and the rest becomes the body. The slug is the frontmatter's `slug`, or the file's path without the extension.

```ts
import { defineConfig, directory } from "tomekit";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineConfig({
  collections: {
    posts: {
      loader: directory("content/posts", { exclude: "drafts/**" }),
      schema: z.strictObject({ title: z.string() }),
    },
  },
});
```

`include` defaults to `"**/*.md"`. Both options take one glob or a list, relative to the directory.

### Your own loader

A loader is an object with a `load` function that returns `entries`. Use it for content that isn't a folder of Markdown, eg JSON or an API.

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

export default defineConfig({
  collections: {
    authors: {
      loader: {
        load: async ({ root, watch }) => {
          watch("data/authors.json");

          return {
            entries: JSON.parse(
              await readFile(path.join(root, "data/authors.json"), "utf-8")
            ),
          };
        },
      },
      schema: z.strictObject({ name: z.string() }),
    },
  },
});
```

Each entry has a `slug`, and optionally `metadata`, `body` and `file`. `load` receives:

- `collection`: the collection's name
- `root`: the project root, as an absolute path
- `dev`: whether the Vite dev server is running
- `watch`: marks files whose changes rerun `load` in dev

Return `issues` for entries that couldn't load and `warnings` for anything else worth saying. The other entries still load. A `load` that throws fails the whole collection.

### Reloading in dev

Call `watch` with globs, relative to the project root, whose changes rerun `load`. Start a pattern with `!` to leave files out. A `!` pattern only applies to the globs from the same call, so a loader that calls `directory(...).load(context)` keeps both sets. `directory()` watches its own files. A loader that never calls `watch` reruns only when the config changes.

### Sharing a loader

`defineLoader` keeps a loader's types when it lives outside the config, eg in its own file.

```ts
import { defineLoader } from "tomekit";

export const authors = defineLoader({
  load: () => ({ entries: [{ metadata: { name: "Ada" }, slug: "ada" }] }),
});
```

To combine sources in one collection, call another loader's `load` inside yours and add your entries to its result.

## Schema

`schema` validates each entry's metadata. Use any validator that implements [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev), eg Zod, Valibot or ArkType.

```ts
posts: {
  loader: directory("content/posts"),
  schema: z.strictObject({
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
    title: z.string(),
  }),
}
```

- The schema's output becomes the document's `metadata`, with its types, so `date` above is a `Date` and `tags` is never missing.
- It must produce an object. A file without frontmatter is validated as `{}`.
- Frontmatter must be keys and values. A YAML list or a single value is an error.
- An issue points at the key's line and column: `content/posts/hello.md:3:1: title:` and then the validator's message. A missing key points at its deepest parent that exists.
- `directory()` reads `slug` before the schema runs. It stays in `metadata` only if the schema keeps it, and `z.object` drops keys it doesn't list.

### Unknown keys

The schema decides what happens to keys it doesn't list. `z.object` drops them, so a misspelled optional key like `modifedAt` builds fine and `modifiedAt` is `undefined`. To fail the build instead, reject unknown keys:

| Validator | Rejects unknown keys           |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Zod       | `z.strictObject({ ... })`      |
| Valibot   | `v.strictObject({ ... })`      |
| ArkType   | `type({ "+": "reject", ... })` |

A strict schema also rejects `slug`, so list it if your files set one, eg `slug: z.string().optional()`.

## References

`references` names the metadata fields that hold slugs of another collection. It sits next to `collections`, keyed by collection name and then by key path.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  collections: {
    authors: {
      loader: directory("content/authors"),
      schema: z.strictObject({ name: z.string() }),
    },
    posts: {
      loader: directory("content/posts"),
      schema: z.strictObject({
        author: z.string(),
        sections: z.array(
          z.strictObject({ author: z.string(), title: z.string() })
        ),
      }),
    },
  },
  references: {
    posts: { author: "authors", "sections.author": "authors" },
  },
});
```

- A path goes through nested objects and arrays, eg `sections.author`. TypeScript accepts only paths to strings or arrays of strings, and names from `collections`.
- Every slug must belong to a document that `collections.get("authors")` returns, so a skipped or broken author doesn't count. Otherwise `vite build` fails, pointing at the file and line. Dev leaves the post out and shows the error in the overlay.
- The check runs on documents after `transform`, and only on strings, so a transform can replace a slug with something else.

In the generated types the field holds that collection's slugs, so following it needs no `undefined` check:

```ts
const post = collections.get("posts").get("hello");

collections.get("authors").get(post.metadata.author).metadata.name;
```

Inside `transform`, `metadata.author` is still a `string`: the check runs after every transform, since a transform's `skip()` decides which slugs exist.
